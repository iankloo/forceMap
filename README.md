# forceMap

This is a package to create force directed maps in R.  Inspiration and code starting point credited to Aaron Bycoffe's block: http://bl.ocks.org/bycoffe/3230965.  Currently, Aaron has no license, so I've reached out to make sure I can use his code (even though it is barely the same).  I will make this a public repo when I hear from him.

## Install
```{r}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("iankloo/forceMap")
```
